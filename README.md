# Sentence-complition
I create a model that predict the next sentence next word using R and corpus of data from twitter, news, blogs from swift I create a uni, bi, tri, tetra, penta gram tokenizers using weka and create TMD for each tokenizer and use it to predict the next word and I made plots to see the most frequent grams using ggplot2
I create slides that explain the process using slidify and deploy those models in wep app using shiny
